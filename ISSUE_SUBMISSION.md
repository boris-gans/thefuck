- the output of `thefuck --version` (something like `The Fuck 3.1 using
    Python 3.5.0`);
- your shell and its version (`bash`, `zsh`, *Windows PowerShell*, etc.);
- your system (Debian 7, ArchLinux, Windows, etc.);
- how to reproduce the bug;
- the output of The Fuck with `THEFUCK_DEBUG=true` exported (typically execute
`export THEFUCK_DEBUG=true` in your shell before The Fuck);
- if the bug only appears with a specific application, the output of that
application and its version;
- anything else you think is relevant.
